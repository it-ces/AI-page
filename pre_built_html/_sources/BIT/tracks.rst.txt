Analitycs and data management 
=================================

The objective is view the material that help to build
a project using pandas and intermediate programming skills, 
for instance we can uses to build projects as:

* Inequality by mortality 
* Educational gap
* Ranking of firms


Machine learning
==========================

Yo can uses Machine learning algorithms in your final projects, as using another related
terms how feature selection.

* Support Vector Machine to predict cancer
* K-means to clients segmentations


Optimization and intelligent systems
======================================

You could uses genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic..

* Feature selection using genetic algorithms
* Traning Neural Networks
